      Track C: Commit (to) the future of sorting!
    </h1>
    <p>
      In Track C, you will contribute towards the <strong>future</strong> of sorting by
      integrating Powersort into a software framework that does not currently use it.

    <p>
      A valid submission for Track C consists of a link to the <strong>public pull
      request</strong> on GitHub or another public code hosting platform where you have
      implemented Powersort.
      You will have to provide a brief description of the software framework and the
      changes you made to integrate Powersort, as well as what sorting algorithms were
      used before.
      The submission also has to prove that you have contributed to the pull request
      yourself
      in a substantial way.
    </p>
    <p>
      To be eligible for a prize in Track C, pull requests have to be accepted by the
      maintainers of project, and the project has to serve a plausible purpose
      (beyond sorting), e.g., demonstrated by its use in other project.

    <h3>How to get started</h3>
    <p>
      Some simple <strong>reference implementations</strong> of Powersort are available in
      the following repositories under a permissive license (MIT software license) that
      you can use as a starting point:

          C++ implementation
        </BLink>
        (from the <a

    </ul>
    <p>
      Apart from these, there are the existing implementation in production that can
      serve as inspiration; (it is your responsibility to check the projects' licenses
      for terms of use):

        (main function <code>list_sort_impl</code>) is written in C.

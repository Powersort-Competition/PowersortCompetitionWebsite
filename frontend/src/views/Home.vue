    <h3>What's Powersort?</h3>
    <p><strong>Powersort</strong> is a refinement of <strong>Timsort</strong>,
      the sorting algorithm developed by Tim Peters for the CPython reference
      implementation of Python.
      Powersort is now used in both CPython and PyPy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sorting is a core step in many computational tasks, and a faster sorting algorithm
      can provide faster
      execution time and reduced energy consumption without changes to application code.
      Based on our research, sorting lists in Python is up to

        40% faster since Python 3.11

      due to Powersort.

      We seek your help in 3 tracks:

        </BLink>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      <strong>Track B</strong> requires <strong>no algorithmic knowledge</strong>;
      you just run your favorite Python project on our virtual machine
      and donate the anonymous performance data to science!
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Track A</strong> requires coming up with some <strong>lists to sort</strong>,
      with the goal to find lists where Timsort and Powersort differ the most.
      We have a demo notebook to get you started and you do not need to have a
      detailed understanding of the algorithms to win (although it doesn't hurt either
      üòâ).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Track C</strong> is for the hands-on <strong>developers</strong>
      who want to bring about change with production code.
      Track C is a bounty for any accepted <strong>pull requests</strong>
      that bring Powersort to a software framework not currently using it,
      as an incentive to invest time on fundamental algorithms that help everyone.
      Your contribution will be recognized and publicized on our 
      website and in our reports.

    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>
      <!--      ‚ÄúYou can't sort this list (with Timsort as fast as you should)‚Äù-->

      Timsort and Powersort are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_sort"><em>adaptive</em>
      sorting algorithms</a>:
      both are faster if the input has long presorted areas (‚Äúruns‚Äù).
      However, they differ in the <strong>merge policy</strong>, i.e.,
      the order in which they combine these naturally occurring into
      longer runs.</p>
    <p>
      Powersort solves this task of finding good merge trees
      by implicitly solving an optimization problem looking for a nearly

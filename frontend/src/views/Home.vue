    <h3>What's Powersort?</h3>
    <p><strong>Powersort</strong> is a refinement of <strong>Timsort</strong>,
      the sorting algorithm developed by Tim Peters for the CPython reference
      implementation of Python.
      Powersort is now used in both CPython and PyPy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sorting is a core step in many computational tasks, and a faster sorting algorithm
      can provide faster
      execution time and reduced energy consumption without changes to application code.
      Based on our research, sorting lists in Python is up to

        40% faster since Python 3.11

      due to Powersort.

      Help us better understand the algorithm's performance in the wild, and bring its
      benefits to other communities.

    <h2>The Powersort Competition</h2>
    <p>
      We seek your help in 3 tracks:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <BLink to="/aboutA">
          <font-awesome-icon icon="puzzle-piece" fixed-width/>
          Track A: <em>Sort this, Timsort!</em></BLink>
      </li>
      <li>
        <BLink to="/aboutB">
          <font-awesome-icon icon="database" fixed-width/>
          Track B: <em>Sorting-in-the-Wild Benchmark</em>
        </BLink>
      </li>
      <li>
        <BLink to="/aboutC">
          <font-awesome-icon icon="code-merge" fixed-width/>
          Track C: <em>Commit (to) the future of sorting!</em>
        </BLink>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      <strong>Track B</strong> requires <strong>no algorithmic knowledge</strong>;
      you just run your favorite Python project on our virtual machine
      and donate the anonymous performance data to science!
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Track A</strong> requires coming up with some <strong>lists to sort</strong>,
      with the goal to find lists where Timsort and Powersort differ the most.
      We have a demo notebook to get you started and you do not need to have a
      detailed understanding of the algorithms to win (although it doesn't hurt either
      ðŸ˜‰).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Track C</strong> is for the hand-on <strong>developers</strong>
      who want to get their hands dirty with production code.
      We simply put out a bounty for any accepted <strong>pull requests</strong>
      that bring Powersort to a software framework not currently using it.

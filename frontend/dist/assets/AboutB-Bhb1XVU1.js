This data will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of adaptive sorting algorithms such as Timsort and Powersort in various applications, and will also be made available under a creative-commons license to the research community for testing the effectiveness of any future algorithms. </p><p> The benchmark will consist of lists of integers representing the relative order of elements sorted in real-life applications. More precisely, we only keep the <em>ranks</em> of the elements in the lists to anonymize the data; the ranks are sufficient to determine the number of comparisons and the merge cost of adaptive sorting algorithms. </p><p> We are interested in any application were many and long lists are sorted using the built-in <code>sorted</code> function or the <code>sort</code> method of lists. <br><em>Any Python application is welcome; the more diverse the data, the better!</em></p><p> Note that scripts that simply sort random or synthetic data are not eligible for Track B; the application or script has to serve a plausible purpose beyond sorting. </p><h2>Track B Instructions</h2><p> A valid submission for Track B consists of a log file <code>arrays.txt</code> produced by our <a href="https://github.com/sebawild/cpython/tree/3.11-instrumented" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> instrumented CPython version</a> and description of how to reproduce the data.

In the virtual machine, you simply install your Python application as you would on your local machine and run it. Our custom CPython version will log the arrays that are sorted (more precisely, the relative order of items in the list) and log this information to a file <code>arrays.txt</code>. </p><p> Need a kickstart in inspiration or a walkthrough with an example on using the VBox image, and generating the <code>arrays.txt</code> file?
